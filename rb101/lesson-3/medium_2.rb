# Practice Problems: Medium 2
# Question 1
# Every named entity in Ruby has an object_id. This is a unique identifier for that object.

# It is often the case that two different things "look the same", but they can be different objects. The "under the hood" object referred to by a particular named-variable can change depending on what is done to that named-variable.

# In other words, in Ruby, all values are objects...but they are not always the same object.

# Predict how the values and object ids will change throughout the flow of the code below:

# Solution 1
# a_outer is 42 with an id of: 85 before the block.
# b_outer is forty two with an id of: 2152729580 before the block.
# c_outer is [42] with an id of: 2152729540 before the block.
# d_outer is 42 with an id of: 85 before the block.

# Notice that Ruby re-used the "42 object with id 85" when the value was the same.

# Notice that Ruby did NOT change the id for any of the objects between outside and inside the block

# Notice that changing the values has forced Ruby to create new objects and refer to them with the original variable names.

# Notice that Ruby re-uses the objects under the hood when it can, but uses different ones for different values.

# Notice that once we leave the block, those variables that were defined inside the block lose their meaning.


# Question 2
# Let's look at object id's again from the perspective of a method call instead of a block.

# Solution 2
# My string looks like this now: pumpkins
# My array looks like this now: ["pumpkins", "rutabaga"]

# The String#+= operation is re-assignment and creates a new String object. The reference to this new object is assigned to a_string_param. The local variable a_string_param now points to "pumpkinsrutabaga", not "pumpkins". It has been re-assigned by the String#+= operation. This means that a_string_param and my_string no longer point to the same object.

# With the array, one array object can have any number of elements. When we attach an additional element to an array using the << operator, Ruby simply keeps using the same object that was passed in, and appends the new element to it.

# So, because the local variable an_array_param still points to the original object, the local variables my_array and an_array_param are still pointing at the same object, and we see the results of what happened to the array "outside" of the method.

# Question 3
# Let's call a method, and pass both a string and an array as arguments and see how even though they are treated in the same way by Ruby, the results can be different.

# Study the following code and state what will be displayed...and why:

def tricky_method(a_string_param, an_array_param)
  a_string_param += "rutabaga"
  an_array_param << "rutabaga"
end

my_string = "pumpkins"
my_array = ["pumpkins"]
tricky_method(my_string, my_array)

puts "My string looks like this now: #{my_string}"
puts "My array looks like this now: #{my_array}"

# Solution 3
# My string looks like this now: pumpkins
# My array looks like this now: ["pumpkins", "rutabaga"]

# The String#+= operation is re-assignment and creates a new String object. The reference to this new object is assigned to a_string_param. The local variable a_string_param now points to "pumpkinsrutabaga", not "pumpkins". It has been re-assigned by the String#+= operation. This means that a_string_param and my_string no longer point to the same object.

# With the array, one array object can have any number of elements. When we attach an additional element to an array using the << operator, Ruby simply keeps using the same object that was passed in, and appends the new element to it.

# So, because the local variable an_array_param still points to the original object, the local variables my_array and an_array_param are still pointing at the same object, and we see the results of what happened to the array "outside" of the method.


# Question 4
# To drive that last one home...let's turn the tables and have the string show a modified output, while the array thwarts the method's efforts to modify the caller's version of it.

def tricky_method_two(a_string_param, an_array_param)
  a_string_param << 'rutabaga'
  an_array_param = ['pumpkins', 'rutabaga']
end

my_string = "pumpkins"
my_array = ["pumpkins"]
tricky_method_two(my_string, my_array)

puts "My string looks like this now: #{my_string}"
puts "My array looks like this now: #{my_array}"

# Solution 4

# My string looks like this now: pumpkinsrutabaga
# My array looks like this now: ["pumpkins"]

# As you can see, we have achieved the opposite effect from our last example.

# We are still passing in the same two string and array arguments, but the results are the opposite, because our method does the "same thing" to each, but in a different way than before. That is, in both cases, the method attempts to change the string from "pumpkins" to "pumpkinsrutabaga" and add "rutabaga" to the array.

# Despite the similarity of the results inside the method definition, the results outside the method definition are the opposite.

# As before, the explanation is all about what Ruby does with a variable when we change the object it points to. Does it create a new object? Or is it able to just modify the existing object? In this case, our literal ['pumpkins', 'rutabaga'] array is a new object, and we are assigning it to the local variable an_array_param.


# Question 5
# Depending on a method to modify its arguments can be tricky:

def tricky_method(a_string_param, an_array_param)
  a_string_param += "rutabaga"
  an_array_param << "rutabaga"
end

my_string = "pumpkins"
my_array = ["pumpkins"]
tricky_method(my_string, my_array)

puts "My string looks like this now: #{my_string}"
puts "My array looks like this now: #{my_array}"
# Whether the above "coincidentally" does what we think we wanted depends upon what is going on inside the method.

# How can we change this code to make the result easier to predict and easier for the next programmer to maintain? That is, the resulting method # should not mutate either argument, but my_string should be set to 'pumpkinsrutabaga' and my_array should be set to ['pumpkins', 'rutabaga']

# Solution 5

def not_so_tricky_method(a_string_param, an_array_param)
  a_string_param += "rutabaga"
  an_array_param += ["rutabaga"]

  return a_string_param, an_array_param
end

my_string = "pumpkins"
my_array = ["pumpkins"]
my_string, my_array = not_so_tricky_method(my_string, my_array)

puts "My string looks like this now: #{my_string}"
puts "My array looks like this now: #{my_array}"


# Question 6
# How could the following method be simplified without changing its return value?

def color_valid(color)
  if color == "blue" || color == "green"
    true
  else
    false
  end
end

# Solution 6

# Ruby will automatically evaluate statements, so this method:

def color_valid(color)
  if color == "blue" || color == "green"
    true
  else
    false
  end
end

# Can be significantly simplified by changing it to just:

def color_valid(color)
  color == "blue" || color == "green"
end

# Both of these methods do exactly the same thing - but one is much more complex to read.
