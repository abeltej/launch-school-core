Problem: 
- Implement a method #substrings that takes a word as the first argument and then an array of valid substrings (your dictionary) as the second argument. It should return a hash listing each substring (case insensitive) that was found in the original string and how many times it was found.

- Next, make sure your method can handle multiple words:



- Input:  string
