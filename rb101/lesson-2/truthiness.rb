#The ability to express "true" or "false" is an important concept in any programming language. It helps us build conditional logic, and understand the state of an object or expression. Usually, the notion of whether a value is "true" or "false" is captured in a boolean data type. A boolean is an object whose only purpose is to convey whether it is "true" or "false".

#In Ruby, booleans are represented by the true and false objects. Like everything else in Ruby, boolean objects also have real classes behind them, and you can call methods on true and false.

true.class          # => TrueClass
true.nil?           # => false
true.to_s           # => "true"
true.methods        # => list of methods you can call on the true object

false.class         # => FalseClass
false.nil?          # => false
false.to_s          # => "false"
false.methods       # => list of methods you can call on the false object

#You can use the two boolean objects in conditionals.

#Example 1 - The below will always output 'hi'.

if true
  puts 'hi'
else
  puts 'goodbye'
end

#Example 2 - Conversely, the below will always output 'goodbye'.

if false
  puts 'hi'
else
  puts 'goodbye'
end

#Expressions and Conditionals
#In real code, you won't use the true or false objects directly in a conditional. Instead, you'll likely be evaluating some expression or method call in a conditional. Whatever the expression, it should evaluate to a true or false object.

#Example 3

num = 5

if (num < 10)
  puts "small number"
else
  puts "large number"
end
#The above outputs "small number" because the expression num < 10 evaluates as true. We can verify in irb:

irb:001> num = 5
=> 5
irb:002> num < 10
=> true
irb:003> (num < 10).class
=> TrueClass

#You can substitute the code expression with a method call too.

#Example 4

puts "it's true!" if some_method_call
#The above will output "it's true!" if some_method_call returns a truthy value.

#When using method calls as a conditional expression in this way, you'll generally want the method to return a boolean rather than relying on the truthiness or falsyness of a non-boolean return value.

#Logical Operators
#Logical operators will return either a truthy or falsey value when evaluating two expressions.

  #&&: this operator is the "and" operator and, in the following examples, will return true only if both expressions being evaluated are true.

#Example 5 - we'll play around with && in irb.

irb:001> true && true
=> true
irb:002> true && false
=> false
irb:003> num = 5
=> 5
irb:004> num < 10 && num.odd?
=> true
irb:005> num > 10 && num.odd?
=> false
#Nothing too surprising. But take notice that we didn't have to put num > 10 in parentheses. This means that Ruby's order of operator precedence considers > as higher precedence than &&. In other words, Ruby didn't get confused; it didn't think you were trying to do this: num > (10 && num.odd?).

#Example 6 - you can chain as many expressions as you'd like with &&, and it will be evaluated left to right. If any expression is false, the entire && chain will return false.

irb:001> num = 5
=> 5
irb:002> num < 10 && num.odd? && num > 0
=> true
irb:003> num < 10 && num.odd? && num > 0 && false
=> false

  #||: this operator is the "or" operator and, in the following examples, will return true if either one of the evaluated objects is true. It's less strict than the && operator.

#Example 7 - only way to return false is if all expressions are false.

irb:001> true || true
=> true
irb:002> false || false
=> false
irb:003> true || false
=> true
irb:004> false || true
=> true
#Short Circuiting: the && and || operators exhibit a behavior called short circuiting, which means it will stop evaluating expressions once it can guarantee the return value.

#Example 8 - the && will short circuit when it encounters the first false expression.

irb:001> false && 3/0
=> false
#Notice the above code doesn't generate a ZeroDivisionError. This is because the && operator didn't even evaluate the second expression; since the first expression is false, it can short circuit and return false.

#Also, notice that false || 3/0 will generate an error.


irb:001> false || 3/0
ZeroDivisionError: divided by 0
#Example 9 - the || will short circuit when it encounters the first true expression.

irb:001> true || 3/0
=> true
#The above code doesn't generate a ZeroDivisionError because || didn't evaluate the second expression; it short circuited after encountering true.

#Similar to before, notice that true && 3/0 will generate an error.


irb:001> true && 3/0
ZeroDivisionError: divided by 0
#Relying on the short circuit behavior can be dangerous, but it's sometimes handy. We'll see some examples of its use in common Ruby code below.

#Hopefully most of the above is review. We haven't even talked about the main topic of this assignment - what does "truthiness" mean and how does it impact our code? We'll tackle that next.

#Truthiness
#After that review of booleans and logical operators, we're finally able to talk about the notion of "truthiness". Truthiness differs from true in that Ruby considers more than the true object to be "truthy". In fact, Ruby is a very liberal language and considers everything to be truthy other than false and nil.

#This means that we can use any expression in a conditional, or with logical operators, and as long as it doesn't evaluate to false or nil, it is considered true. Note that an expression that Ruby considers true is not the same as the true object. This is what "truthiness" means. Let's take a look at an example.


num = 5

if num
  puts "valid number"
else
  puts "error!"
end
#If you didn't know Ruby at all, you might guess that the above should either output "error!", or the program should generate an error of some sort. But if you run that code, it will actually output "valid number". The reason is because Ruby considers any integer to be "truthy". It does not, however, mean that the num variable from above is equal to true:


num = 5
num == true        # => false
#This means that even the integer 0 is considered truthy, which is not the case in some other languages. Rubyists take advantage of truthiness in Ruby to write some interesting code. For example, sometimes you'll see assignment in a conditional or logical operator:


if name = find_name
  puts "got a name"
else
  puts "couldn't find it"
end
#Presumably, the find_name method will either return a valid object, or it will return nil or false. Writing code like that is dangerous and can be easily misunderstood by others as equality comparison, rather than assignment.

#More common, you'll see code like this:


name = find_name

if name && name.valid?
  puts "great name!"
else
  puts "either couldn't find name or it's invalid"
end
#The if conditional above is checking that name is not nil, then checking the validity of name. It's doing this by relying on the && short circuit behavior to not execute name.valid? if name is nil. Remember that && short circuits if it encounters a false, and nil is considered "falsy".

#The valid? method called above is not a built-in Ruby method, but something the programmer has defined elsewhere in his code.

#It can get confusing when incorporating conditionals, logical operators and truthiness considerations. But with the knowledge of the above, practice slowly taking apart complicated code.

#Remember this rule: everything in Ruby is considered "truthy" except for false and nil.
