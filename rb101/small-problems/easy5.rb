Write a method that determines and returns the ASCII string value of a string that is passed in as an argument. The ASCII string value is the sum of the ASCII values of every character in the string. (You may use String#ord to determine the ASCII value of a character.)
=end
ascii_value('Four score') == 984
ascii_value('Launch School') == 1251
ascii_value('a') == 97
ascii_value('') == 0
=begin
The time of day can be represented as the number of minutes before or after midnight. If the number of minutes is positive, the time is after midnight. If the number of minutes is negative, the time is before midnight.

Write a method that takes a time using this minute-based format and returns the time of day in 24 hour format (hh:mm). Your method should work with any integer input.

You may not use ruby's Date and Time classes.

=end
time_of_day(0) == "00:00"
time_of_day(-3) == "23:57"
time_of_day(35) == "00:35"
time_of_day(-1437) == "00:03"
time_of_day(3000) == "02:00"
time_of_day(800) == "13:20"
time_of_day(-4231) == "01:29"
=begin
As seen in the previous exercise, the time of day can be represented as the number of minutes before or after midnight. If the number of minutes is positive, the time is after midnight. If the number of minutes is negative, the time is before midnight.

Write two methods that each take a time of day in 24 hour format, and return the number of minutes before and after midnight, respectively. Both methods should return a value in the range 0..1439.

You may not use ruby's Date and Time methods.
=end
after_midnight('00:00') == 0
before_midnight('00:00') == 0
after_midnight('12:34') == 754
before_midnight('12:34') == 686
after_midnight('24:00') == 0
before_midnight('24:00') == 0
=begin
Given a string of words separated by spaces, write a method that takes this string of words and returns a string in which the first and last letters of every word are swapped.

You may assume that every word contains at least one letter, and that the string will always contain at least one word. You may also assume that each string contains nothing but words and spaces
=end
swap('Oh what a wonderful day it is') == 'hO thaw a londerfuw yad ti si'
swap('Abcde') == 'ebcdA'
swap('a') == 'a'
=begin
Given a string that consists of some words (all lowercased) and an assortment of non-alphabetic characters, write a method that returns that string with all of the non-alphabetic characters replaced by spaces. If one or more non-alphabetic characters occur in a row, you should only have one space in the result (the result should never have consecutive spaces).

cleanup("---what's my +*& line?") == ' what s my line '
